Title: Fingerprint-based clustering of flow cytometry data
Version: 0.3.0
Author: Wade Rogers
Maintainer: Wade Rogers <wade.rogers@spcytomics.com>
Description: Fluster combines the speed and efficiency of Cytometric
    Fingerprinting (implemented in flowFP) with hierarchical agglomerative clustering.
    Conventional clustering is too slow to deal with the millions of data points (events)
    that are commonly encountered in flow cytometry data.
